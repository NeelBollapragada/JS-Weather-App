# Weather App made in JS

Super simple weather web app made with HTML, CSS and JavaScript - literally only has 60 lines of script, not even its own dedicated `.js` file. Extremely basic design and was made when I was first learning javascript. All weather information is requested from [Open Weather](https://openweathermap.org/).
